    <h1>Swap It Out</h1>
    <p>
        Lyrics: Justin Bieber

    <p class="esquerda">
        Eye for an eye <br>
        Remember when I told you <br>
        Wipe your pretty eyes, dry 'em on my shoulder? <br>
        You ain't gotta try <br>
        Try to get closer
    </p>
    <p class="centralizado">
        Fifty-fifty deal <br>
        Let's make a deposit, simulate the love <br>
        Try it'fore you knock it, you ain't gotta rush <br>
        But you ain't gotta stop, babe
    </p>
    <p class="direita">
        Open up to me, it's all you gotta do <br>
        Give me all your heart, I swap mine out with you <br>
        Swap it out with you <br>
        Swap it out with you <br>
        Come into my  world <br>
        I'll give my world to you <br>
        We can swap, swap, swap it out 
    </p>
